## `cifar10` folder

CMSIS NN Lib example arm_nnexample_cifar10 for
  Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7.

The example is configured for uVision Simulator as well as the STM32F407 DISCOVERY board.


## `script` folder 
It contains a Python Jupyter notebook to generate  `#define IMG_DATA {...}` data with a new custom image.

For more information, please read the tutorial.

Please noted that the microcontroller project is built with Keil MDK-ARM run on Windows, if you don't have the IDE installed yet, you can find a copy and instruction to install [here](TODO).
